<h1>Queue</h1>
<hr>
<i> <br>A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming that follows the principle of "first in, first out" (FIFO).</i>

<br>
It is used to store and manage a collection of elements or items in which the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of a queue as a line of people waiting for a service, where the person who arrives first is the first one to be served.
